    "Four models were trained and compared using default parameters to establish baseline performance and efficiency. Logistic Regression achieved a test accuracy of 88.74%, which is almost identical to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model at 88.68%. While SVM produced slightly higher training accuracy, its training time was significantly longer (about 45 seconds versus less than a second for Logistic Regression). This reflects SVM’s higher computational cost due to the complexity of finding the optimal separating boundary, especially in high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved comparable accuracy (87.77%) but required minimal training time since it performs most of its computation during prediction rather than fitting. Meanwhile, the Decision Tree model recorded the highest training accuracy (91.88%) but the lowest test accuracy (86.42%), indicating signs of overfitting — the model fits the training data too closely and generalizes poorly to unseen data.\n",

    "The results showed that the best-performing model used L2 regularization, with a C value of 0.01 and no class weighting. In simpler terms, this means the model favored stability and simplicity. The L2 regularization (also called Ridge) helps prevent overfitting by keeping the model’s focus evenly spread across all input features instead of letting a few dominate. The C value of 0.01 tells the model to be more disciplined—smaller C means stronger regularization, which keeps its predictions more general and less sensitive to noise in the data. Finally, setting class_weight to None means the model treated both “yes” and “no” outcomes equally, without giving extra importance to the smaller “yes” group. Altogether, this combination produced a model that was steady, well-generalized, and achieved the highest PR-AUC score in testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s PR-AUC score of about 0.20 means that, on average, it was able to find the real “yes” cases better than random guessing, but it’s still far from perfect. To put it simply, this score measures how well the model identifies clients who would actually say “yes” to a bank offer while avoiding too many false alarms. A perfect score would be 1.0, while a model that guesses randomly would score around 0.11, since only about 11% of people in the dataset said “yes.” So, a score of 0.20 shows that the model is learning meaningful patterns and performing better than chance, which is a good starting point for such an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I varied the model’s internal settings — how strict it should be (C), what kind of regularization to use (L1, L2, ElasticNet), and whether to rebalance the rare “yes” responses —to see which combination finds the most “yes” clients without too many false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using plain accuracy, I optimized for PR-AUC, a metric that rewards the model for correctly finding the small number of real “yes” cases. This makes the model far more useful for targeted marketing, where missing potential customers matters more than making a few extra wrong guesses.\n"

    "The results show how well the model performed before and after adjusting its decision threshold. At the default 0.5 cutoff, the model achieved about 88.7% accuracy, but that number is misleading—it predicted almost everyone as “no,” completely missing the smaller group of clients who actually said “yes.” This is confirmed by the balanced accuracy of 0.5 (meaning it ignored the “yes” group) and an F1 score of 0.0, showing no successful positive predictions. The ROC-AUC of 0.65 and PR-AUC of 0.20 indicate that the model has some ability to distinguish “yes” from “no,” but it wasn’t using it effectively. After tuning the threshold to 0.125, the model began identifying more “yes” cases: its F1 score improved to 0.26 and balanced accuracy rose to 0.60, meaning it became fairer to both groups. The confusion matrix confirms this shift—while it now makes more mistakes on “no” predictions, it finally detects many true “yes” cases. In plain terms, lowering the threshold helped the model move from being overly cautious to more useful for identifying potential customers who might actually say “yes.”"

    "The Precision–Recall Curve shows an average precision (AP) of 0.200, meaning the model achieves about 20% precision on average. This indicates that while the model performs better than random guessing, it still faces challenges due to class imbalance. As recall increases beyond 0.2–0.3, precision drops significantly—a common pattern when working with highly imbalanced datasets."

    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve provides important insight into my model’s performance. With an AUC of 0.65, the model performs slightly better than random guessing, indicating that it has learned some useful patterns but still needs improvement through further feature engineering and fine-tuning. I’m encouraged that the model can already identify patterns that help predict which clients are more likely to say “Yes” to a term deposit—allowing marketers to prioritize potential customers and focus their efforts more efficiently."

    "At the default threshold of 0.5, the model predicts “No” for all clients, missing every potential customer due to class imbalance. When the threshold is lowered to 0.133—the point that maximizes the F1-score—the model successfully identifies 642 positive cases, though it also introduces more false positives. This trade-off improves the model’s usefulness for marketing purposes, allowing it to identify clients who are more likely to say “Yes” to a term deposit."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe I’ve finally completed training and fine-tuning my Logistic Regression model, even though the researchers originally preferred using SVM. Since I didn’t have the computing resources required for SVM, I decided to focus on Logistic Regression instead. I made several adjustments to feature engineering, and the process is best understood by reviewing the accompanying notebook for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I’ve learned is that even though Logistic Regression is one of the simplest algorithms to train, it still requires multiple rounds of iteration and tuning to achieve reasonable performance. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only about 11% of customers saying “Yes” to a term deposit, which makes it difficult for the model to learn meaningful patterns. While my model performs slightly better than random guessing, this experiment showed me the importance of hyperparameter tuning, threshold adjustment, and class balancing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, Logistic Regression proved to be fast, economical, and interpretable, helping me build a solid understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning. From a business standpoint, the model can still provide value to the bank’s marketing team. Even if its accuracy is modest, it can identify a small but meaningful group of customers who are more likely to say “Yes” to a term deposit—allowing marketers to prioritize outreach and improve campaign efficiency.\n",
